Database Testing Using SQL: 



What you need to know as Tester: 

1. structure of the database 
2. to interact to database - 
CRUD 
create
read 
update
delete

SQL >> structured query language 
3. need to check if data is created, read, updated or deleted properly in the database

mysql server
oracle database
microsft sql server

key point 1: data is always stored in different tables 
columns - fields 
rows - record - entry 

SQL - is not a programming language 
query lanaguage 

CRUD 




CRUD >> 

creating data >> its not your responsibility 
reading data >> testers need to know that 
updating >> 
delete >> 

Readind data: 

Select columnname from tablename where filtering criterian 

add multiple conidition of filtering tecniques 

and >> coniditon1 and condition2 >> both condition has to be true
or >> coniditon1 or condition2 >> one condition will bring the data

prob 1: customername, city of the customers from uk and usa 

I want to see the list of customers and their city from germany who are buying the product where the price is between 30 and 40 >> join


1. columns you want see
2. which table/tables these columns are coming from 
3. all the recode or entries/or condition

Select columnsname from tablename where filtering  

ASC >> default >> lowest to highest for numbers
alphabetical order 

DESC >>  highest to lowest 
reverse alphabetical order

FIFO 

Aggregate functions in sql 

min
max
avg
sum
count

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = germany or country = france or country = uk 

subqueries >> 

Structure of the database: 

database >> tables 
table >> columns, rows 

1. type of data in a column, datatype
2. nature of data 

Basic data type of the column 

char(5)
varchar(20)
Text >> 256 
INT >> 65K
blob >> pics, video

data type 
firstname >>varchar(20) NOt null
lastname>>varchar(15)NOt null
email>> varchar(40), UNIQUE
age >> INT, Default = 0 
orderprice >> INT 
ssn >> char(9) Primary key, 
city >> Default City = DC

constraints 

NOT NULL >> there must have to data 
NULL >> default , O 
UNIQUE>> no repeating data in the field 
Primary key >> Unique + not null
Check >> putting an specific condition 
Default >> putting a data when some field is left NULL 
Foreign Key >> 

compound primary key >> dob_whichcarbought_city

customer information 

email >> primary key

order information >>

Create Table Customers
(

firstname Varachar(50) NOT NULL 
lastname Varachar(50) Default = "Noname"
age INT Check Age>20
ssn Char(9) UNIQUE
email Varachar(50) Primary Key
address Varachar(50) NOT NULL 
pic  blob Default = location of the pic

)

mapping the table with the front end

Join 

Structure of read data

Select columns 
from tablename 
where filtering 

multiple tables >> at least 2 tables 

joins

foreign key 


e-commarce business 
customers table
order table 
credit card table
address table 


primary key: finding one specific information from one table
foreign key: making relation between multiple table 

Scnairo: find out what GK bought 

Select customers.firstname, order.product
from Customers inner join order
Having customers.cid = 4
On customer.cid = order.oid

How much money gk spent: 

Select customers.firstname, SUM(order.price)
from Customers inner join order
Having customers.cid = 4
On customer.cid = order.oid
Group By customers.firstname

inner join >> when we get only matching data from both table
full outer join >> we get all data from all the data 
left join >> all data from left table only matching data from right table 
right join >> all data right table only matching data from left table 

Select customers.firstname, order.product
from Customers right join order
Having customers.cid = 4
On customer.cid = order.oid

Scenario: want to see the customer name with product they bought


(customer inner join order) inner join address 

(customer inner join order) full outer join address 

(customer inner join order) left join address 

joining two tables >> each record has to have relation with a record or multiple records on another table based on the foreign key

sprint - 2

1 person 1 day work 

10 story point - for each sprint 

4 backlogs >> 10 story points 

setting up the env - 2 
regression tests - 1 
new test case - 5 
Read >> 
create >> table
update table (any structure of the data), data(recode or entries)
delete table, data ( record or entry) 

drop table tablename>> table will be completely deleted 
truncate tablaname>> it will only delete the data in the table 

you can update the structure >> columns 

Alter table customer drop firstname
Alter table customer modify firstname varchar(45) Not NULL
Alter table customer add emailaddreess varchar(45) Not NULL

updating data 

update customer set age=21, password=dsflkjdfj+ where ssn=343434

delete customer where ssn= 343434

how to insert data in a table 


INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');

end-to-end testing >> UI , API , Database 

1. I know sql queries 
2. testing - mapping, constraing, integrity
3. end-to-end

UI - user interface testing 

UI testing >> 70 perenct 
api testing>> 13/14 percent 
database testing >> 5-7 percent
