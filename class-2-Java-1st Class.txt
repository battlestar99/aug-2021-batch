what is computer programming? 

giving instructions to the computer

using different programming language 

java, python, C#

what we do in computer programming? 

we create a process>> 

what computer can do? 

1. computer can deal with data 

2. conditional statement 

3. looping

4. data structure - array 

5. Method/functions 

Structure of java - 

jdk >> java development kit
jre >> java runtime environment 
+ java core library 

eclipse >> programming editor 
IDE - integrated development environment 

what is the basic unit of java? 

package >> java folder
class >> test script
method>> 
main method>> is the starting point of any code 
method >> you can only use when you need 

class + main method >> java runnable class
class >> java non-runnable class

scope >> starting point and ending point 

{ }


1. computer can deal with data 

amount of money
ssn 
name
website url
address 

35 
mike
www.google.com
to store data >> 

need to create a variable 

x = 12; 

name = "mike"

every variable is a memory space in your computer 

what kind of data you want to store? 

integer >> can store any whole number
string >> can store any set of characters
double >> can store any decimal number
boolean >> true/false 



you want to store a number 105 

what type of variable is x? 

int x = 105; 

String name = "mike";

10.10

double y = 10.10; 

boolean flag = true; 


datatype variable_name= data; 

int a; 
a=10.10
String firstname; 

double y; 
y=10.10


step 1: variable declaretion
int b ; 
step 2: initialize a variable 
b = 12; 

two steps together

int b = 12; 






int x ; 

x is an integer type of variable

double y 

y is a double type of variable

String ssn 

ssn is a string type of variable 

key point: java is a case sensitive programming language

a and A 
b and B 
car plate number

12-2343

767667887



2. conditional statement 

statement execute based on condition

you will buy a car if you get the car in 5000 dollar

you will go to walmart if there is no raining 

if(condition){

// statement 

}

= assigning a value 

x = 5; 

y = 129;

x==5 >> false

if(condition) {

// code you are writing 

}
