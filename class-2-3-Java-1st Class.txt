what is computer programming? 

giving instructions to the computer

using different programming language 

java, python, C#

what we do in computer programming? 

we create a process>> 

what computer can do? 

1. computer can deal with data 

2. conditional statement 

3. looping

4. data structure - array 

5. Method/functions 

Structure of java - 

jdk >> java development kit
jre >> java runtime environment 
+ java core library 

eclipse >> programming editor 
IDE - integrated development environment 

what is the basic unit of java? 

package >> java folder
class >> test script
method>> 
main method>> is the starting point of any code 
method >> you can only use when you need 

class + main method >> java runnable class
class >> java non-runnable class

scope >> starting point and ending point 

{ }


1. computer can deal with data 

amount of money
ssn 
name
website url
address 

35 
mike
www.google.com
to store data >> 

need to create a variable 

x = 12; 

name = "mike"

every variable is a memory space in your computer 

what kind of data you want to store? 

integer >> can store any whole number
string >> can store any set of characters
double >> can store any decimal number
boolean >> true/false 



you want to store a number 105 

what type of variable is x? 

int x = 105; 

String name = "mike";

10.10

double y = 10.10; 

boolean flag = true; 


datatype variable_name= data; 

int a; 
a=10.10
String firstname; 

double y; 
y=10.10


step 1: variable declaretion
int b ; 
step 2: initialize a variable 
b = 12; 

two steps together

int b = 12; 






int x ; 

x is an integer type of variable

double y 

y is a double type of variable

String ssn 

ssn is a string type of variable 

key point: java is a case sensitive programming language

a and A 
b and B 
car plate number

12-2343

767667887



2. conditional statement 

statement execute based on condition

you will buy a car if you get the car in 5000 dollar

you will go to walmart if there is no raining 

if(condition){

// statement 

}

= assigning a value 

x = 5; 

y = 129;

x==5 >> false

if(condition) {

// code you are writing 

}

Problem: 

you need to create a software that will calculate the 
monthly payment of a car dealership 

baseprice
dealership fee 
credit score>> apr 
6 years/7years 
tax 

400 

monthly payment >> for the car buyer 




20000 + 300 >> 20300 

tax >> 20300*(5/100)









100 + 10 >> 110 

5 percent >> (5/100)*110 = 5.5 

total price = 110 + 5.5 = 115.5 

115.5-20 = 95.5 

apr = 2 

(2/100)*95.5 = 1.91 

95.5 + 1.91 = 97.41 

6 years = 72 months 


monthly payment = 97.41/72 = 1.35

datatype variablename = data; 

if(conditon){


}


int x = 45; 
double y = 56.87; 
string name = "mike";
boolean flag = false; 





conditonal statment: 

if(condition) {

// 5 lines of code here 

}

== comparision operator 

=    assignment operation

int x = 12; 
int y = 15; 

x = y ; 





condition 

x==y >> true/false
x>y>> true/false
x<y  

boolean x; 

x = (x>y)

code 

if(condition) else
if ( condition) else
if (condition) else 


if(condition) {


}


java project - learningJava >> 

jre system library

          >> class name conditionalTesting with main method 

         Problem: create 3 integer variables with the name x, y, z  , put any value you want
 two boolean variable, flag1 , flag2 
            flag1 = (x>y+z) if(flag1){print "x is greater than summation of y and z"}
else{"conidtion one is false"}
           
      flag2 = (x> y-z) if(flag2){x is greater than y subtract 
z}
else( condtion two is false)
