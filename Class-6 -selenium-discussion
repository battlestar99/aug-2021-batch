interacting with the browser - brwoser automation 
google chrome
mozila firefox
IE
safari
opera 

can't do>> 
anything that is outside of the brwoser

Test case >> Test Script 

Test case and Test scripts 

Test case >> execution manually >> 20 test cases 
Test script >> execution by running the code >> 1000 test cases

90 percent of the application are browser based 

web based - 
window/mobile based - 

test script - interact with the browser 

Test report/result

compare expected and actual result 



webelements / web objects 

are components of web page that an user can interact - 

text box - type something
